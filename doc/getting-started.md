# Running Galaxy

Please refer to [building](building.md) for building docker image first or using the newest image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tkestack/galaxy).

Copy all files in yaml directory to you kubectl client machine.
And then docker push your image to Docker hub or private registry server.

## Starting Galaxy daemonset

```
# Please update image prefix in these yamls
kubectl create -f galaxy.yaml
```

## Update Kubelet command line args

Add ```--network-plugin=cni --cni-bin-dir=/opt/cni/bin/``` these args to kubelet and restart it.

## Starting Flannel

Galaxy uses Flannel by default to create an overlay network for Pods. Please refer to [flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) to install Flannel.

Please refer to [Galaxy configuration](galaxy-config.md) if you don't wand to install Flannel and want to change the default network.
